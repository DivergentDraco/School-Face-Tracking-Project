# Introduction

Head tracking is an alternative way to compensate for eye tracking, it was implemented by using the camera to detect one of the components of the face. This small project came to light after we initiated a detailed analysis through tests, questions, and surveys throughout the school.

This repository was made specifically for the **ISSP Project** dedicated to the Sri Sangwan School. Implemented by using open-source face tracking.

# Project Overview

**Sri Sangwan School** is an institution that provides inclusive education for children with disabilities. Our project mission is to assist them by making insightful research recommendations that will make digital education more accessible. Read more about Sri Sangwan School ([>>here<<](http://www.swn.ac.th/mainpage))

This project focuses on improving the well-being of Sri Sangwan School by providing research recommendations through surveys, interviews, classroom observations, and group study. Later on, after testing the available eye-tracker, Beam Eye Tracker, we believe head tracking could be an alternative that is much more sturdy, less fatigued, and precise than an eye-tracking system.

## Our purpose and objective
The objective of this project is to try and see methods that can be used within Sri Sangwan School's computer science lab, which houses students that has loss of limb, uncontrollable muscle, or Cerebral Palsy, etc.

### Coding language used
#### To install the program, you will need the programs and files as stated:
##### Required Programs and Files
 - Python **3.9.13** ([Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3913/))
 - Provided file in the repository

##### Required Equipments
 - **Webcam** is an important equipment for tracking the face. Low quality webcam is encouraged with 30 fps laptop webcam is enough.
   Recommendation is Logitech C270 HD which costs around 590 baht.

> [!WARNING]
> Unlike the eye tracking repository, this head tracking doesn't consume budget on programs.

> [!WARNING]
> > This small head-tracking project is in development progress. Which does not intend to be implemented due to many factors such as calibration and sensitivity problems. This project was made to help with recommendations to the school and give other future teams to help with decision-making.



# Issues
Considering that head tracking has less problems due to better precision, it has little problem that can be usable if implemented correctly.

- Head movement\
  Some students at the school may suffer from abnormal neck muscle movement. Further study and troubleshooting needs to be conducted.
